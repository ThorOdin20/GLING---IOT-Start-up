# GLING---IOT-Start-up
Gling is an innovative IoT solution designed to create a dynamic office ecosystem that encourages spontaneous social and professional interactions.

We designed and implemented Gling in the Design Factory, Aalto University, Finland in one month. I was in charge of the engineering part: hardware and software. Together with Fihlman Emil and Pekka Parkkonen we chose the components, designed the hardware connectivity, implemented the circuit, created the arduino code and the cloud aspects, using simple echo websocket. 

I would advise using a SEEED STUDIO XIAO ESP32S3 WIFI+B microcontroller instead of the ESP32C3 one since we encountered some limitations in the processing speed. 
In the NETWORK.h file place the WebSocket certificate where it is indicated.
